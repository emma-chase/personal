      <h2>Studies</h2>
      <p>
        I am studying Business Analytics and Psychology and am graduating in the
        spring of 2025! I am passionate about using data to tell the stories of
        people and better understand HR workplace trends.
      </p>

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Holmes Murphy</h3>
      <p>
        During the Summer of 2024, I was an intern for a subsidiary of Holmes
        Murphy called "ethOs". In this role, I did analytics work to better
        understand the engagement and employee satisfaction of various clients.
        My ultimate goal was to utilize data to help companies improve their
        workplace culture. I continued this role throughout the Fall of 2024 and
        have since transitioned to another role within Holmes Murphy. Upon
        graduating, I will work full-time with Holmes Murphy.
      </p>
      <h3>Bambuddha Group</h3>
      <p>
        In the Summer of 2023, I interned abroad in Sydney, Australia. This was
        a unique way to experience the culture of Australia through the working
        lens.
      </p>

      <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
      <h3>Tippie Senate</h3>
      <p>
        After joining Tippie Senate in the Fall of my freshman year, I became
        very actively inolved in the happenings of senate. I have held the
        following roles while in senate:
      </p>

        <li>2024-25: Co-Director of the Case Competition</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Multicultural Business Student Association</h3>
      <p>
        Upon coming to Iowa, I sought out opportunities to expand my cultural
        awareness and learn about cultures beyond my own. I found MBSA within
        one of the first weeks of my first year and immersed myself in all that
        it had to offer. I've held the following roles within MBSA:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2022-23: Vice President of Operations</li>
        <li>2023-24: Senior Vice President</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Kairos</h3>
      <p>
        Kairos is the campus ministry that I am apart of at the University of
        Iowa. My faith is very important to me and I am thankful to have a
        community like Kairos.
      </p>
      <h3>Triathalon Club</h3>
      <p>
        Growing up as a swimmer and runner, I have always been curious about
        doing a triathalon. In the spring of my Sophmore year, I completed my
        first tri and have been hooked every since. I am apart of the Tri Club
        at Iowa and am inspired by the work-ethic and dedication of my fellow
        teammates.
